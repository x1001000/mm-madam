<h1>What do the different abbreviations like SA, NSA, SAAR, YoY, MoM, QoQ, and CA mean?</h1>
<p>SA refers to ''seasonal adjustment,'' which is a statistical method used to remove effects of seasonal patterns in a dataset. SAAR stands for ''seasonally adjusted annual rate,'' which means the data is seasonally adjusted and annualized. We mark a dataset with ''(SA, YoY)'' to indicate that the data has been seasonally adjusted and is compared with the same period last year (also known ''year-on-year''). Indicators not accompanied with any of these abbreviations are generally not seasonally adjusted (NSA).<br><br>MoM and QoQ mean the data is compared with the previous month or quarter.<br><br>Lastly, there is also CA, which stands for ''calendar adjustment,'' a statistical method for removing the calendar effects from the data, taking into account variation in the number of holidays in different months.</p>
