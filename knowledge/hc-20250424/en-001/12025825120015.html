<h1>What are the "Latest Value" and "Watermark" features?</h1>
<p>The "Latest Value" and "Watermark" features are exclusive to MM Business subscribers. When enabled, the "Latest Value" displays the most recent data point at the top left of the chart and can be exported along with the chart, saving time on post-editing. The "Watermark" feature allows you to export charts with or without a watermark, offering flexibility for professional use. Both features are practical tools for reports and presentations.</p>
