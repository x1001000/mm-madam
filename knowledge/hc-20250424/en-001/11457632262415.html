<h1>Why do the subscription plans show prices in USD, but the actual payment is charged in TWD?</h1>
<p>To avoid confusion, all plan descriptions are displayed in USD before proceeding to the payment method selection. However, the chosen payment method may be linked to different payment gateways, leading to variations in the payment currency.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Below is some clarification regarding the payment options for your selected plan: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Using PayPal</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you select PayPal as your payment method, the final price will be in USD.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Using a Credit Card</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you decide to pay directly with a credit card, please note that although the plan amount will be displayed in TWD, your bank will automatically convert the amount into the billing currency of your credit card during the transaction. For instance, if your credit card is billed in USD, the bank will convert the TWD into the equivalent amount in USD and process the payment accordingly. <br>Regardless of your location, if you choose to use Credit Card as your payment method, the amount will always be displayed in TWD.<br>If you have multiple currency options for credit card payment, please make sure to select payment in NTD(New Taiwan Dollars) during the binding process.</p>
