<h1>I signed up for the free trial. Why did I get charged even though it's still two days away from the free trial's expiration?</h1>
<p>As stated in the description of our free trials, your subscription will be auto-renewed with the monthly/yearly plan (based on the corresponding promo terms)<span dir="ltr"> when the free trial ends, with the billing date set at 2 days before the trial ends.</span></p>
