<h1>It's still two days until my free trial ends. Why have I received a payment confirmation email?</h1>
<p>If you do not cancel your subscription during the trial period, we'll assume you wish to keep enjoying the subscription services. We set the billing date for subscription renewals at 2 days before your ongoing subscription's expiration date for the following reason:<br>This allows users some time to update their credit card info when renewal payment doesn't go through, so that they won't lose the favorable subscription rate due to an expired credit card. (About the favorable rate: as a special thank you for long-term users, we offer users who sign up with auto-renewals with credit card payment to keep the same subscription rate they originally signed up for for life, even when prices increase in the future.)</p>
