<h1>What can I do if we've reached the monthly download limit?</h1>
<p>MM Business <strong>monthly plan</strong> provides a shared monthly data download quota of <strong>200 entries</strong> for team members, whereas the <strong>yearly plan</strong> provides a shared monthly data download quota of <strong>500 entries</strong> for team members.</p>
<p>If your team has exceeded this quota for the month, you can either wait until the next month to receive a new quota or contact us at <a rel="noreferrer">business@macromicro.me</a> to purchase additional quota.</p>
